Learning Go by Building Servers 😁   
[![](https://github.com/athul/GoBack/workflows/Go/badge.svg)](https://github.com/athul/GoBack/actions)
-----

Basically a `main.go` file with some functionalities in `/ping` and `/wubba` (as of now 😅 )

Clone the Repo, Install dependencies like 
```sh
$ go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin
```
To start the Server, Run    
`go run main.go`
